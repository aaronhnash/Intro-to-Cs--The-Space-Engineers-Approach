# Overview

Since I had run into some problems with my earlier Unity project (since I didn't know C#), I decided I'd try my hand at learning it! 

This project is mostly a stepping stone, a proof of concept meant to help me learn the syntax of C#. There's so much more I'd like to do now that I have a good starting grasp on the langage! I mostly wanted to learn C# so that i could write in-game scripts for a game I've been playing, [Space Engineers](https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/). But before I can learn how to run (or rather, fly), I must first learn to walk.

# Development Environment

This software was developed in Visual Studio Code, using the Code Runner extension and the scriptcs package.

I used C# for this project, using only default libraries specified in my code.

# Future Work

There's a lot that I could do for this project, both expanding on this little game that I made as well as finishing my initial plan of writing a script to help me control my space ship in Space Engineers.
* Balance the game a little bit more, ie. provide a cap on how many of each kind of collector I can make
* Add error and exception handling
* Develop a small script in Space Engineers to efficiently control thrusters
